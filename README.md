# ML-Q1-Project

Description:
According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, approximately 68% of convicted criminals commit a second crime within three years of release from jail. This trend highlights the necessity for strategies to address recidivism as repeat offenders not only overburden the legal system but also pose security risks to communities. In this project, our goal is to develop a comprehensive risk assessment model that identifies characteristics and behavioral patterns of criminals at high risk of reoffending. Specifically we looked at socio-economic, psychological, and environmental factors.
Leveraging data-driven insights from this study, legal institutions would have the tools necessary to identify potential repeat offenders and allocate targeted resources for their rehabilitation.This would invariably enhance public safety while ensuring high risk offenders receive adequate support throughout rehabilitation. This model could also provide valuable insights for policymakers, allowing them to design more effective parole conditions and post-release programs.

Steps:
1. Run train test.py on a dataset
2. Run attribute selection on the given training dataset in WEKA
3. Select on the given attributes and remove the other attributes in WEKA
4. Create a model in WEKA using a classification algorithm and use it to test on the testing dataset.
